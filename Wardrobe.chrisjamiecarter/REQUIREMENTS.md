## Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you should store and retrieve wardrobe data..
- [x] You should use a Blazor Webassembly project.
- [x] You can choose whatever database solution you want: Sqlite, SQL server or whatever you're comfortable with.
- [x] Since we'll only have basic CRUD operations, you should use Entity Framework.
- [x] Your database should have a single table. The objective is to focus on learning Blazor, so we should avoid the complexities of relational data.
- [x] Users of your app need to be able to upload pictures of wardrobe items.
- [x] You CAN'T USE Javascript interop. The objective is to stay away from JS, even though it's still possible to use it.
